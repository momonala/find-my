"""Spyglass wiring for this service.

Importing this module configures remote log shipping (attaches a handler to the
root logger) and returns a metrics collector. Import it once per process entry
point (api.py, poller.py) — importing it again elsewhere is safe since Python
caches modules, but calling `initialize()` directly a second time would attach a
duplicate log handler and double-ship every log line.
